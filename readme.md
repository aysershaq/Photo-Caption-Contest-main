# 📸 Photo Caption Contest

**Photo Caption Contest** is a Back-End application built with **Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL**.  
It allows users to participate in a photo caption competition where they can submit captions and vote for the best ones, with a secure role-based authorization system suitable for production environments.

This project is designed to be **production-ready**, scalable, and aligned with Back-End best practices.

## 🔐 Role-Based Access Control

| Role  | Permissions                                |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| user  | Create captions, vote, delete own captions |
| admin | Delete any caption, manage user roles      |

> ⚠️ Users **cannot** change their own roles.  
> Role updates are restricted to Admin users only.

## 🗄️ Database Design

### Core Tables

- **Users**
- **Photos**
- **Captions**
- **Votes**

### Key Constraints

- A user can vote **only once per caption**  
  (Composite UNIQUE index on `userId + captionId`)
- Deleting a caption automatically deletes related votes  
  (`ON DELETE CASCADE`)
